#  Rank/ELO Simulator

A lightweight simulation engine for ranking systems used in competitive games (similar to Elo in chess or MMR in online games like League of Legends, Valorant, Dota 2 and CS2).

This project simulates rating progression between players, visualizes how ratings evolve through repeated matches, and demonstrates how matchmaking systems work internally.

##  Features

-  **Player-based rating model (MMR/ELO)**
-  **Match simulation: Player vs Player**
-  **Rating updates based on classic Elo formula**
-  **Optional win streak bonus (Arcade Mode)**
-  **Rating decay for inactive players**
-  **Batch simulation mode — run 1000+ matches automatically**
-  **(Planned)** Data export to JSON / CSV for visualization

What This Project Demonstrates

This project is perfect for showcasing:

Understanding of ranking algorithms used in real games.

Ability to write clean and modular Python code.

Game systems design thinking (MMR distribution, fairness, progression).

Open-source readiness: documentation, repository structure, code clarity.
